# First words
I'm a no-experience developer(or actually I'm just a high school student that dream high), so in this project should be plenty of mistake and wrong things that I couldn't see yet. So if you spent your time here, please give me some issues to fix and improve.
# Plan:
### HTML Parser: I think it's good enough
### CSS Parser: Currently working on
### DOM: 
With these parser results, I will make my own DOM_Builder then the DOM_Tree will be intermidiate presentation for the Compiler
### Compiler:
Will be the last and hardest thing to do. It will compile DOM_Tree to eventually machine code, but in the middle I haven't decided yet.
